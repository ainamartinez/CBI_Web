# CBI Web developement

This repository is for the web implemetation of teams 2 and 4 of CBI 2024 (Course Based in Innovation). The website aims to provide users with information about their water consumption and how they compare to other users within a ranking system. Users who perform well in conserving water will receive small incentives as rewards. See [General Git repository of CBI](https://github.com/ainamartinez/CBI_Code) to know more about the whole software solution related to data visualization.

# Overview

The Web/App component of our project aims to provide users with an interactive platform where they can monitor their water consumption, receive tips and tricks for water conservation, and participate in gamification activities to encourage water-saving behaviors.

The app will display real-time data processed from Grafana, allowing users to see their consumption patterns and compare their usage with others. Additionally, the web will feature a system to manage incentives and rewards for top savers, along with a dedicated section for project updates and water-saving information.

[React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library developed by Facebook, is an excellent choice for building this Web/App due to its component-based architecture and efficient rendering capabilities. React allows developers to create reusable UI components, ensuring a consistent and high-performance user experience across web and mobile platforms when combined with React Native.

## Digital prototype

To follow the process of creating the web, we start by doing a digital prototype with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) tool. We aim to express our initiative with a minimalist website that incentivizes users and encourages them to take part in the initiative, especially through the ranking and reward sections.

## React website
To develop the app, as mentioned before, we'll use React. You can find all the process and related code in another repository: [CBI_Web](https://github.com/ainamartinez/CBI_Web).

### Template usage: 
Since we are not experts in React, we based our project on a pre-existing template. This template provides a solid foundation and allows us to focus on implementing the specific features required for our project.
